## Overview

ALAS (Automated Learning Assessment System) is a project aimed at harnessing generative AI to create learner-centered and evidence-based instructor feedback. Developed in collaboration with Harvard Medical School's MD Program Pathways curricular track, this project seeks to revolutionize medical education by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence as a tool for faculty to more deeply understand how students are performing holistically, outside of traditional quantitative grading.


## Usage

ALAS's Web App is currently in development, but will be accessible to HMS faculty beginning Aug 6, 2024. Check back here for important updates and access information.
